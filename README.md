## Overview

FoxTune is a **post-installation tuning tool** for Linux desktops, focused on **responsiveness**.  

> The goal is to **improve interactive performance** for desktop users, without installing additional software or manually tweaking low-level settings.

## Motivation

Linux defaults are safe but generic.

FoxTune bridges the gap between safe defaults and optimal responsiveness on modern desktops, without forcing the user to manually tweak low-level settings.

## Usage

```bash
sudo perl src/foxtune.pl
```
