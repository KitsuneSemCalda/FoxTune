# FoxTune

A little configurator to turn the linux desktop in a responsive machine without heavy manual configuration

## Overview

FoxTune is a post-installation tuning tool for Linux desktops. Its goal is to optimize system responsiveness by applying sensible kernel and I/O settings based on the user's hardware, without installing additional applications or altering the system fundamentally.

## Motivation

Linux defaults are safe but generic. FoxTune bridges the gap between safe defaults and optimal responsiveness on modern desktops, without forcing the user to manually tweak low-level settings.

## Usage

```bash
sudo perl foxtune.pl
```
